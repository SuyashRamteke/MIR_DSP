Audio signal processing for machine learning

I explored audio feature extraction with related applications.

Developed a thorough understanding of audio editing, working with sinusoids, magnitude and phase estimation
and time and frequency analysis of waveforms and implemented from scratch.

Worked on Monophonic pitch detection using autocorrelation, zero crossing rate and average magnitude difference
functions and implemented simple query by humming systems

Understood the importance of chroma features, MFCCs and spectrogram and gained insight of which features to use
for which application

Familiarized with tempo estimation(Onset detection using spectral flux, rms median) and beat tracking using librosa.
Gained hands on experience with Sonic Visualizer tool
